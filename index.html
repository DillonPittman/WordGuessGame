    placeholder picture with ?
    have all presidents in an array, all picture links in parallel array
    get random number between 0 and 44
    use random number [x] to call name
    turn name into blanks
    take user key inputs
    if correct, change blanks to that letter
    else add key input to list of incorrect inputs
    when there are no more blanks, display name and image [x] and play sound
